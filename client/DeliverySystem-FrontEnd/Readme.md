Our project deals with vegetable delivery, which helps in connecting fresh produce farmers with customers through a collaborative approach. The project aims to aggregate demand and supply, so as to connect the consumer with fresh produce, and help farmers build scale.
Details of every vegetable crop are stored, which includes the name of the vegetable, its selling price per kilogram, and the area of farmland that is currently cultivating that particular vegetable. This will help the farmers see and decide which particular vegetable to cultivate and grow. This would help them in understanding which vegetables are in demand and needs more supply and which ones are being grown in excess, in order to decrease the wastage, which in order will help in normalizing the rates of these vegetables.
